How do you do Route Planning?
  Ahead of time. By zipcode/area only. 
Do you use route manipulation?
  Move stops between routes. Clean up ordering. Order by city, for ex. Actual order is up to driver. Athim Logistics route optimization. 6 routes.
  (We are replacing the functionality of the cross reference stuff)
Same location same day?
  By customer. Special rules. Pickup routes would be but he doesn't do it.
Uses route optimisation software for quotes?
